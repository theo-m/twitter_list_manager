# Twitter list manager

Twitter lists are an appealing feature, but very poorly served by the web UI.
This is a CLI tool to make and manage twitter lists.

It expects you to fill a `.env` file like so, head to [this page](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) to get your secrets:
```shell script
ACCESS_TOKEN='<your secret>'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='<your secret>'
API_KEY='<your secret>'
API_SECRET_KEY='<your secret>'
```

Then simply
```shell script
$ ./list_manager.py
```
